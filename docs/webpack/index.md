# Webpack

> At its core, webpack is a static **module bundler** for modern JavaScript applications. When webpack processes your application, it internally builds a dependency graph which maps every module your project needs and generates one or more bundles.

For a quick high-level overview on what Webpack is, how it works and its core concepts, read the [Concepts](https://webpack.js.org/concepts/) guide from the Webpack docs.

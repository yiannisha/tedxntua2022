# Webpack: Project structure

* `bundles/`  
  * `build-dev/`  
    Contains the generated *development* bundles.
  * `dist/`  
    Contains the generated *production* bundles.
  * `webpack-config/`  
    Contains the Webpack configuration files. `dev` (development) and `prod` (production) configurations inherit from `base`. To understand Webpack's configuration syntax, check the [docs](https://webpack.js.org/configuration/). To understand the plugin functionality and configuration, check this [short guide](https://eldarion.com/blog/2018/10/09/setup-guide-django-vue-webpack/) that was used as an inspiration.
    * `webpack.base.conf.js`  
    * `webpack.dev.conf.js`
    * `webpack.prod.conf.js`
  * `package.json`  
    This serves as npm's build script and management tool. The most significant parts are the dependencies (names of packages and their versions) and the scripts (shortcuts for commands).

    `npm run build`, `npm run build:dev` are defined here and are used to run Webpack with the corresponding configuration files as arguments.
  * `package-lock.json`  
    Check [npm's documentation](https://docs.npmjs.com/files/package-lock.json).
  * `webpack-stats.dev.json`
  * `webpack-stats.prod.json`  
    These files are auto-generated by the Webpack plugin [`webpack-bundle-tracker`](https://github.com/owais/webpack-bundle-tracker) and are used as an information gateway between Webpack and Django, via the Django library [`django-webpack-loader`](https://github.com/owais/django-webpack-loader). Django integration is explained in more detail [here](django.md).
